    <h1>My Areas of Interests:</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Music:</h2>
    <p>- I have been playing guitar since I was 16 years old, so for almost about 10 years.
        <br>And for the last 4 years I have been really interested in learning to play
        other instruments 
        <br>and making my own music. There are many things I still don't 
    know about, but learning is part of the fun. 
    </p>
    <h2>Sports:</h2>
    <p>- I participated in several sports when I was in middle school such as basketball, 
        soccer, volleyball, etc. </p>
    <p>- When I started my junior year in highschool however, I have developed a keen interest
        in 
        <br>martial arts and fitness so I decided to follow my pursuits in the form of 
        various martial arts such as 
        <br>boxing, muay thai, and kickboxing along with working 
        out in the gym on my free days.
    </p>
    <p>- I'm 26 now, and I still workout in the gym and do a little boxing whenever I find 
        the opportunity.
    </p>
    <h2>Reading: </h2>
    <p>- One thing I'm grateful for studying English Literature in University is that it 
        sparked my love for reading
        <br> any piece of Literature I can get my hands on, something
        that I never really had before University.
        <br>My favorite genres are Fantasy, Horror, 
        and Postmodern fiction.
